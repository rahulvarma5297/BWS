I have a lot of extensions since I'm using VS Code since 3 year's
and all the extensions are kept in the folder.

New Extension which I downloaded (other all I have already).
Todo Tree
Material Theme
Django Template
EditorConfig for VS Code
Markdown Preview Enhanced
Power Mode

I don't like much Material Theme
So I kept it disabled.

But I liked Power Mode.

Thank You.
